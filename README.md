# MLM & eCommerce Backend API

## Overview

This project is a backend API for a dynamic Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) platform integrated with a mini eCommerce flow.  
It features a real-time 3-level MLM user tree, product listing, cart and checkout, mock payment simulation, an admin panel, referral code system, and AI-powered product suggestions using OpenAI.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following keys (replace with your actual values):

```bash
PORT=
MONGO_URI=
PAYMENT_MOCK_API=
JWT_SECRET=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

Installation & Running Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Run tests
npm test

# Start the server
npm run start
```

Using Docker
Build and run the container locally:

Testing
Run the test suite with:

```bash

npm test
```
Tests cover validation, core business logic, and API routes.

Challenges & Solutions
Dependency conflicts: Resolved peer dependency issues between openai and zod by using npm ci --legacy-peer-deps in CI pipeline.

Real-time updates: Implemented Socket.IO to keep MLM tree synchronized on user joins in real-time.

Payment simulation: Designed a mock payment API that mimics real payment behavior without external dependency.

AI integration: Used OpenAI's GPT API to provide intelligent product recommendations, improving user experience.

Deployment & CI/CD: Dockerized the app and automated testing, building, and deployment with GitHub Actions for consistent delivery.

Code Quality
Well-structured with modular routes, controllers, and services

Zod schemas ensure strong input validation

Meaningful, documented code with JSDoc comments

CI pipeline runs automated tests and linting on every push/pull request
